Default is to run 'short' 'conveyance' and 'long' tests
    -s    Run 'short' test. If specified, will always run first
    -c    Run 'conveyance' test. Will only run if drive supports it.
    -l    Run 'long' test

    -c and -l will run in the order specified

Examples
    $0 -s -c; Run 'short' and 'conveyance' tests only
    $0 -c -l; Run 'conveyance' and 'long' tests only
    $0 -l -c -s; Run in order, 'short', 'long', and 'conveyance' tests
